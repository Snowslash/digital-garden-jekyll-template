- We were born to work together like feet, hands, and eyes, like the two tows of teeth, upper and lower. To obstruct each other is unnatural. To feel anger at someone to turn your back to him: these are obstructions
- Stop allowing your mind to be a slave, to be jerked about by selfish impulses, to kick against fate and the present, and to mistrust the future
- People who labour all their lives but have no purpose to direct every thought and impulse toward are wasting their time - even when hard at work
- Even if you're going to live three thousand more years or ten times that, remember: you cannot lose another life than the one you're living now or live another one than the one you're losing
- ...the longest lived and those who will die soonest lose the same thing. The present is all that they can give up since that is all you have, and what you do not have, you cannot lose
