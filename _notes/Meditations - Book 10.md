- Everything that happens is either endurable or not. If it is endurable, then endure it. Stop complaining. If it is unendurable then stop complaining. Your destruction will mean its end as well.
- If they've made a mistake, correct them gently and show them where they went wrong. If you can't do that, then the blame lies with you. Or no one.
- Why all this guesswork? You can see what needs to be done. If you can see the road, follow it. Cheerfully, without turning back. If not, hold up and get the best advice you can.
- To stop talking about what the good man is like, and just be one.
- Stop whatever you're doing for a moment and ask yourself: Am I afraid of death because I won't be able to do this anymore?
- When faced with people's bad behaviour, turn around and ask when have you acted like that. Your anger will subside as soon as you recognise that they acted under compulsion
- Learn to ask of all actions, "Why are the doing that?" Starting with your own
