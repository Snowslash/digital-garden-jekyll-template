#### Intro to Chords
- Major chord are notes 1-3-5 of tje [[Major Scale]]
	- Most chord extensions are odd numbers because they're built in thirds
- Jazz has a focus on 7th chords
	- 1-3-5-7
	- Different combinations of the major third and minor third can give you different 7th chords
	- Major 7
		- 1-maj3-5-maj7
		- So  C major 7 would be C-E-G-B
	- Minor 7
		- 1-min3-5-min7
		- So C minor 7 would be C-E<sup>b</sup>-G-B<sup>b</sup>
	- Dominant 7
		- 1-maj3-5-min7
		- Major triad with a minor 7th
		- So C dominant 7 would be C-E-G-B<sup>b</sup>

#### Chord Extensions
- The 1-3-5-7s are called chord tones
- Above these you can add chord extensions (9-11-13)
- Chord extensions are always built from the major scale
- These extensions can be altered (flattened or sharpened)

#### ii-V-I Progression
- Built from scales
- The 2/5/1 refers to which note from the scale the chord is built from
- Sometimes the progression is cut short 
	- Sometimes you get a ii-V
	- Other times it might be just the V-I
- Minor ii-V-I progressions are built from the **harmonic** minor scale

#### Jazz Scales
- Make sure the scale you're playing agrees with the chordal tones (1-3-5-7)
- The 2-4-6 can be tweaked (flattened and sharpened)
- Chordal tone + whole step principle
	- Chordal tones first then add a whole step to the 1-3-5 (a whole step being 2 semitones)
