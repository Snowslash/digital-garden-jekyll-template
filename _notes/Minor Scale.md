- There are 3 different types of minor scale
	- Natural minor ([[Modes|Aeolian Mode]])
		- Take a major scale and flatten the 3rd, 6th and 7th notes
		- In semitones: 2-1-2-2-1-2-2
	- Harmonic minor
		- Same as a natural minor but the 7th note is raised by one semitone
	- Melodic Minor
		- Has different ascending and descending notes
			- Ascending has a flat 3rd
			- Descending has a flat 3rd, 6th and 7th (effectively a natural minor)
