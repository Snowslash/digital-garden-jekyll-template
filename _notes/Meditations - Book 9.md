- Injustice is a kind of blasphemy. Nature designed rational beings for each other's sale: to help - not harm - one another, as they deserve. To transgress its will, then, is to blaspheme against the oldest of gods
- Everything is in flux. And you too will alter in the whirl and perish
- All that you see will soon have vanished, and those who see it will vanish themselves, and the ones who reached old age have no advantage over the untimely dead.
