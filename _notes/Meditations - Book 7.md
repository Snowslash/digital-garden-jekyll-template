- Surrounded as we are by all of this, we need to practice acceptance. Without disdain. But remembering our own worth is measured by what we devote our energy to.
- Focus on what is said when you speak and on what results from each action. Know what the one aims at, and what the other means.
- Don't be ashamed to need help. Like a soldier storming a wall you have a mission to accomplish. And if you've been wounded and you need a comrade to pull you up? So what?
- Forget the future. When and if it comes you'lll have the same amount of resources to draw on
- Frightened of change? But what can exist without it? What's closer to nature's heart? Can you take a hot bath and leave the firewood as it was? Eat food without transforming it? Can any vital process take place without something being changed?
- Everywhere at each moment you have the option:
	- to accept this event with humility
	- to treat this person as he should be treated
	- to approach this thought with care, so that nothing irrational creeps in
- Don't pay attention to other people's minds. Look straight ahead, where nature is leading you
- Perfection of character: to live your last day, every day without frenzy, or sloth, or pretense
- It is silly to try to escape other people's faults. They are inescapable. Just try to escape your own.
