- Everything you're trying to reach - by taking the long way around - you could have right now, this moment. If only you'd stop thwarting your own attempts
- It never ceases to amaze me: we all love ourselves more than other people, but care more about their opinion than our own
- Like the impresario bringing down the curtain on an actor: "But I've only gotten through three acts!" Yes. This will be a drama in three acts, the length fixed by the power that directed your creation, and now directs your dissolution. Neither was yours to determine.
- So make your exit with grace - the same grace shown to you.
