I figured it might be better to record the paintings I found interesting here (in higher quality) instead of taking photos at the gallery.

#### Saints Fabian and Sebastian by Giovanni di Paolo

- St Fabian is shown on the left with a papal tiara
- St Sebastian is depicted with lots of arrows because that's how he was martyred (by Emperor Diocletian - well known for retiring as emperor of the Roman Empire to tend cabbages)


#### The Battle of San Romano by Paolo Uccello

- When seen in person the soldier lying on the ground to the left of the white horse ridden by Niccol√≤ da Tolentino always seems to point their feet towards the viewer


#### The Family of Darius Before Alexander by Paolo Veronese
