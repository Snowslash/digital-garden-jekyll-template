- Nuclear waste has to be kept separated for a long time from the biosphere (>10,000 years is the amount used classically but for certain isotopes like Plutonium-239 it's over 24,000 years)
	- For perspective 10,000 years ago:
		- The city of Byblos was first settled, making it one of the oldest continously inhabited cities in the world
		- Cattle were first domesticated 
		- Cultivation of barely and wheat began in Mesopotamia
		- The latest subgroup of human population consisting of those that were all common ancestors of all present day humans lived

- Some interesting solutions to this problem are:
	- Written word
		- Human written tradition only goes back about 5,000 years and most old languages are very hard to decipher; requiring a specialist and some guesswork
		- This would mean that the message would need to be revised over long periods of time 
		- There's also the added complexity of accounting for multiple languages as well
		- In the end the message was written in the most common languages and the plan is to expand this to include every language
		- Pictograms were also considered but rejected due to the ambiguity they would have in interpretation
		- Artificial satellites to broadcast information from orbit to Earth
	- Physical markers
		- Spikes to scare people away
		- Large slabs to make the land uninhabitable and unfarmable 
		- Large blocks arranged irregularly to suggest a network of streets to create a powerful sense of dread
		- Simply hiding the storage site so well that future generations could only reach them by high technical ability
	- Cultural memory
		- Create a religion to preserve the knowledge through rituals and myths
		- Genetically modify domestic cats so that they change colour in the presence of dangerous levels of radiation and then create folk-lore/[catchy songs](https://emperorx.bandcamp.com/album/10000-year-earworm-to-discourage-settlement-near-nuclear-waste-repositories) about moving away from sites where this happens
			- In a similar fashion to this: Atomic Flowers which are genetically modified to only grow in areas close to where radioactive waste is buried which also have data about the location and contents encoded in its DNA
