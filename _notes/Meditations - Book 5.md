- At dawn, when you have trouble getting out of bed, tell yourself: "I have to go to work - as a human being. What do I have to complain of, if I'm going to do what I was born for - the things I was brought into the world to do? Or is this what I was created for? To huddle under the blankets and stay warm?"
- If an action or utterance is appropriate, then it's appropriate for you. Don't be put off by other people's comments and criticism. If it's the right thing to say or do it, then it's the right thing for you to do or say
- So there are two reasons to embrace what happens. One is that it's happening to you. It was prescribed for you, and it pertains to you. The thread was spun long ago by the oldest cause of all. The other reason is that what happens to an individual is a cause of well-being in what directs the world of its well-being, its fulfillment, of its very existence even.
- Keep in mind how fast things pass by and are gone - those that are now, and those to come
- Nothing is stable not even what's right here. The infinity of past and future gapes before up - a chasm whose depths we cannot see
- So it would take an idiot to feel self-importance or distress. Or any indignation either. As if the things that irritate us lasted
- Remember:
	- Matter. How tiny your share of it.
	- Time. How brief and fleeting your allotment of it.
	- Fate. How small of a role you play in it..
- So other people hurt me? That's their problem. Their character and actions are not mine. What is done to me is ordained by nature, what I do by my own.
- The mind is the ruler of the soul. It should remain unstirred by agitations of the flesh - gentle and violent ones alike 
	- When they make their way into your body...don't try to resist the sensation. The sensation is natural. But don't let the mind start in with judgments, calling it good or bad
- I was once a fortunate man but at some point fortune abandoned me. But true good fortune is what you make for yourself. Good fortune: good character, good intentions and good actions.
