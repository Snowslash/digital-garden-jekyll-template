- Many lumps of incense on the same altar. One crumbles now, one later, but it makes no difference
- Not to live as if you had endless years ahead of you. Death overshadows you. While you're alive and able - be good
- But suppose that those who remembered you were immortal and your memory undying. What good would it do to you?
- What use is praise, except to make your lifestyle a little more comfortable
- Beautiful things of any kind are beautiful in themselves and sufficient to themselves. Praise is extraneous.
- Life is short. That's all there is to say. Get what you can from the present - thoughtfully, justly
- Survey the records of other eras and see how many others gave their all and soon died and decomposed into the elements that formed them
- Time is a river, a violent current of events, glimpsed once and already carried past us, and another follows and is gone
- Suppose that a god announced that you were going to die tomorrow or the day after. Unless you were a complete coward you wouldn't kick up a fuss about which day it was - what difference would it make? Now recognise that the difference between years from now and tomorrow is just as small
- To pass through this brief life as nature demands. To give it up without complaint
- Take the shortest route, the one that nature planned - to speak and act in the healthiest way. Do that and be free of pain and stress, free of all calculation and pretension
