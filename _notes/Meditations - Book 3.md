- So we need to hurry. Not just because we move daily closer to death but also because our understanding-our grasp of the world-may be gone before we get there.
- You need to avoid certain things in your train of thought: everything random, everything irrelevant. And certainly everything self-important or malicious.
- He keeps in mind that all rational things are related, and that to care for all human beings is part of being human
- How to act:
	- Never under compulsion, out of selfishness, without forethought, with misgivings
	- No surplus words or uncecessary actions
	- To stand up straight - not straightened
- Never regard something as doing you good if it makes you betray a trust, or lose your sense of shame, or makes you show hatred, suspicion, ill will, or hipocrisy, or a desire for things best done behind closed doors
- Your ability to control your thoughts - treat it with respect. It's all that protects your mind from false perceptions
- Each of us lives only now in this brief instant. The rest has been lived already, or is impossible to see. The span we live is small - small as the corner of the earth in which we live
- Doctors keep their scalpels and other instruments handy, for emergencies. Keep your philosophy ready too - ready to understand heaven and earth.
- If all the rest is common coin, thne whaat is unique to the good man?
