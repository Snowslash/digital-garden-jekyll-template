> Our politics, religion, news, athletics, education and commerce have been transformed into congenial adjuncts of show business

> As I write the President of the United States is a former Hollywood movie actor

Almost 30 years later [we had another one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXE3Ku-mGrk) (well he had a TV show too).

> We are all, as Huxley says someplace, Great Abbreviators, meaning that none of us has the wit to know the whole truth, the time to tell it if we believed we did, or an audience so gullible as to accept it

 In the era of instant news and algorithmically delivered content makes us even greater abbreviators. There is often just not enough time to find out the whole truth before the news cycle finishes and the next story breaks and quite often the whole truth is obscured and the waters deliberately muddied to make it a little harder to find.

> As the influence of print wanes, the content of politics, religion, education and anything else that comprises public business must change and be recast in terms that are more suitable to television

And once again it must change and be recast in terms that are more suited to the internet - short clips and attention catching headlines to drive clicks

> Each medium like language itself makes possible a unique mode of discourse by providing a new orientation of thought and for expression 

<br>

> People like ourselves may see nothing wondrous in writing, but our anthropologists know how strange and magical it appears to a purely oral people - a conversation with no one and yet with everyone

> In every tool we create, an idea is embedded that goes beyond the function of the thing itself (for example eyeglasses refuting the belief that anatomy is destiny)
