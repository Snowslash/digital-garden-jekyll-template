- The best revenge is not to be like that
- Pride is a master of deception: when you think you're occupied in the weightiest business, that's when he has you in his spell
- It's the truth I'm after and the truth has never harmed anyone. What harms us is to persist in the self-deceit and ignorance.
- Remember - your responsibilities can be broken down into individual parts as well. Concentrate on those, and finish the job methodically - without getting stirred up or meeting anger with anger
- And for a human being to feel stress is normal if he is living a normal human life
	- And if it's normal, how can it be bad?
- When you need encouragement,, think of the qualities the people around you have. Nothing is as encouraging as when virtues are visibly embodied in the people around us.
- You accept the limits placed on your body. Accept those placed on your time
- Ambition means tying your well being to what others do. Self indulgence means tying it to the things that happen to you. Sanity means tying it to your own actions.
- Practice really hearing what people say. Do your best to get inside their minds
- What injures the hive, injures the bee
